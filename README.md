# family-tree-mapper
A tool for visualizing ambiguous geodata from family tree (GEDCOM) data

These scripts were used to 1) convert GEDCOM files containing family tree data into JSON, CSV and GeoJSON format, and 2) geocode ambiguous birthplace information to allow mapping the family tree. The end result is a [pretty cool map](https://timpel.github.io/projects/family_tree_mapper/) (made with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)).
